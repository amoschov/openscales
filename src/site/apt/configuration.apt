	A usual question, especially from OpenLayers users, is how do I customize OpenScales on runtime. Indeed, unlike Javascript, ActionScript produce compile (SWF) application.

	To customize OpenScales at runtime, you can use XML configuration to configure your application. When OpenScales is integrated in a professional application, the XML configuration file is usually generated dynamically thanks to server side technology like PHP, Ruby or JSP.

	You can check this {{{configuration/sample.xml}sample xml configuration file}} to build your own. A XML schema will be provided in 1.2 release. To use this functionality, check Map and Configuraton classes AsDocs.
