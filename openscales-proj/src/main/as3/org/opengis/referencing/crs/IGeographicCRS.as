	 * A coordinate reference system based on an ellipsoidal approximation of the geoid; this provides

	 * earth's surface.
	 *  A geographic CRS is not suitable for mapmaking on a planar surface, because it describes
	 * geometry on a curved surface. It is impossible to represent such geometry in a Euclidean plane
	 * without introducing distortions. The need to control these distortions has given rise to the
	 * development of the science of map projections.
